            <p class="lead">This is a UI redesign project that spanned 3 weeks. Our team was tasked with finding a local non-profit website that could benefit from a redesign. After some research, our team found that The Wild Animal Sanctuary was a non-profit that spoke to us, and that the website could use a redesign as well as new information architecture and sitemapping. We were able to create a high-fidelity prototype that reflected all of the design choices we believe would improve The Wild Animal Sanctuary's website. </p>

            <h1 class="display-4">Overview</h1>
            <p class="lead"> </p>When given the task to redesign a local, non-profit website, a member of our team suggested The Wild Animal Sanctuary. After the team read about the non-profit's mission, we felt an emotional connection to the non-profit. Due to this, we envisioned a redesign of the website that would help users feel a deeper emotional connection to the non-profit as well. After taking a look at the navigation bar, and the contents of the website, we also set out to create an easier navigation for users, with a focus on creating a simpler happy path for donations in order to benefit the non-profit as well.

            <p class="lead"> </p>The team consisted of 3 UI/UX designers who worked collaboratively to tackle tasks. Our tasks included user research, creating a value proposition, creating a storyboard and proto/user personas, user flow map, creating a new and improved navigation bar, sitemap, and information architecture. In addition, our team conducted user testing and interviews. Our team also created a style guide for our new UI, and we created a high fidelity prototype to reflect our suggested changes.

            <h1 class="display-4">User Research</h1>
            <p class="lead"></p>Our user research consisted of creating a proto/user persona, and conducting interviews with individuals on what they would want to see on this website. A storyboard, value proposition, and the I Like/I Wish/What If method were also created. Our team also created a feature prioritization matrix, and gained key insights from initial user testing of the original website.

            <h1 class="display-4">Definition & Synthesis</h1>
            <p class="lead"> From our user research, we gained great feedback, including input that users would like to see where and how donations are being used. We also gained good insight on the pain points users had with the website, including feedback that the current site is overwhelming and confusing for the user. Users also pointed out that they wanted a simpler donation process, and that they would be more inclined to donate with a simpler process. Keeping these key points in mind, we were able to formulate a redesign that reflected these desired attributes. </p>

            <h1 class="display-4">Ideation</h1>
            <p class="lead"> Keeping in mind the key features that needed an immediate redesign, our team chose to focus on 3 main pages for this first iteration of a redesign. The pages we focused on were the donation happy path, the homepage, and the donation (Ways to Help) page. A style guide was created during this phase, which contained design elements that were to be utilized on the 3 main pages our team chose. A wireframe, revised information architecture, user flow, and sitemap were also created during this time to reflect feedback from user research. Heuristic evaluations to the website were also conducted in order to gain a better understanding of which revisions to make. </p>

            <h1 class="display-4">Prototyping</h1>
            <p class="lead"> Iterating on our wireframe, our team was able to produce a high-fidelity prototype that encompassed all of the goals our team had in mind for the new redesign. A simplified homepage and navigation bar allowed for users to navigate the site in a less confusing manner. A carousel was added to the homepage to showcase the mission of the organization, and also create a feeling of an emotional connect to the organization by showcasing pictures of rescued animals. In addition, a before & after slider was added in order for users to have a visual representation of how their donations help the organization. A simplified Ways To Help page helped create a happy path for users to donate, as well as the addition of a Donation CTA button on every page.  </p>

            <p class="lead"> User testing provided great feedback, and a 100% success rate on completing the tasks assigned. Testing tasks included being able to navigate to the Ways to Help page, and completing a donation using either the Donation CTA or Ways to Help page. All test users agreed that the new redesign displayed the necessary information in a aesthetic and pleasing manner, and that users would be more inclined to donate due to the before & after sliders and happy path for donations.</p>
